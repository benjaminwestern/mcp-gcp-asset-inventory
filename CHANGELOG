## [1.0.0] - 2025-06-13

### Initial Release ðŸŽ‰

This is the first public release of the **MCP Cloud Asset Tool**. This version provides a single, powerful tool for listing Google Cloud Platform (GCP) assets, exposed via the Multi-purpose Copilot Protocol (MCP).

### Added

- **Core `list_gcp_assets` Tool:**
  - Integration with the Google Cloud Asset API v1 to fetch cloud resources.
  - Requires a target Google Cloud `project_id`.
  - Supports optional filtering by a list of `asset_types` (e.g., "storage.googleapis.com/Bucket").
- **MCP Server Implementation:**
  - Built using the `mcp-go` library to expose functionality as a compliant tool.
  - Runs as a standard I/O (stdio) server, ready for integration with MCP-compatible clients.
- **JSON Output Formatting:**
  - Returns a JSON array of asset summaries upon successful execution.
  - Each summary includes the asset's `name`, `asset_type`, and `location`.
- **Project Scaffolding:**
  - Initial `go.mod` to manage dependencies (`cloud.google.com/go/asset` and `github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go`).
  - `README.md` with basic setup and usage instructions.
  - `LICENSE` file (e.g., Apache 2.0 or MIT).
  - Basic `.gitignore` for Go projects.
